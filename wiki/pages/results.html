  <p class="paragraph fade-in">
    After running PCR on and purifying several different parts that we planned
    on conducting research with, our team ran the first set of experiments to
    compare the success of fluorescent signals of mEmerald and mScarlet with the
    MucK clone. Samples in the presence of different concentrations of TPA and
    different concentrations of IPTG were assayed.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph fade-in">
    IPTG is a molecular compound used as an inducer of gene expression from a
    promoter linked to the operon of certain bacterial strains. In the absence
    of IPTG, the repressor protein binds to the operator region, preventing
    downstream transcription of the gene. Therefore, IPTG theoretically must
    also be present, in addition to TPA, to allow transcription of the reporter
    protein and achieve a fluorescent signal. We expected the fluorescence to
    initially increase with greater concentrations of IPTG as more binds to the
    repressor, then the increase to gradually taper off as the binding
    approaches its saturation point (when all available repressor proteins are
    bound to IPTG).
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph fade-in">
    In addition, we expected the fluorescent signal to increase with greater
    concentrations of TPA, as the presence of TPA should result in more cellular
    processes that theoretically enhance the transcription of the reporter
    protein, until the binding reaches a saturation point, and the increasing
    fluorescence tapers off.

  <p class="paragraph fade-in">
    The measurements of fluorescence demonstrated the noticeable background
    signal in the readings as the signal reaches around 200 in mScarlet with
    MucK and around 500 in mEmerald with MucK in the control group with a 0 µM
    TPA concentration. This group was predicted to have no fluorescence signal.
    Furthermore, theoretically there should be no increase in signal when the
    IPTG concentration is 0 µM as IPTG (represented by blue on the graphs) is
    required to facilitate TPA production. However, the signal increases from
    199.106 to 341.493 with mScarlet and from 537.617 to 846.374 with mEmerald
    as TPA concentration increases.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph fade-in">
    The largest fold increase produced in MucK with mScarlet was around 2.25,
    whereas the largest fold increase for MucK with mEmerald was roughly 1.77.
    While these were both observable changes, they were not significant enough
    increases to achieve our goals in developing a sensitive biosensor for TPA.
    However, the results were compared with past literature and the use of the
    MucK importer was found to be more successful than previously-tested TpaK
    importer.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph fade-in">
    Building on this experiment, our team decided to use the MucK clone with the
    mEmerald reporter protein, but also explored other modifications to improve
    the sensitivity of the plasmid. mEmerald was chosen over mScarlet as they
    have a negligible difference in increased sensitivity, but mEmerald has a
    higher signal production in general, indicating potential for a larger
    ceiling value and ease to work with.

  <h1 class="heading fade-in">Fluorescent Signals of Promoter Modifications</h1>
  <hr class="fade-in" />
  <p class="paragraph fade-in">
    Instead of focusing on the reporter protein and importers used, the next set
    of experiments focused on modifications to the promoter to increase
    sensitivity. Three independent modifications were made to the promoter and
    compared: removing a potential second restriction binding site, replacing
    the critical -10 and -35 sigma factors of the promoter with the
    corresponding sigma factors on pTPA3 (a promoter used in previous papers),
    and replacing the entire promoter with pTPA3.

    </em>
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="paragraph fade-in">
    The first modification (in blue) of removing a potential second restriction
    binding site did not impact the fluorescence signal with increasing levels
    of TPA concentration. The third modification (in yellow) of replacing the
    promoter with pTPA3 had an inverse relationship with TPA concentration.
    Neither of these emit a higher fluorescence signal in the presence of more
    TPA, and therefore would not make effective biosensors. However, the second
    modification (in red) of exchanging has a positive increasing relationship
    with the increasing concentration of TPA, making it the best candidate to
    improve sensitivity of the plasmid.

  <h1 class="heading fade-in">Proof of Concept</h1>
  <hr class="fade-in" />
  <p class="paragraph fade-in">
    Theoretically, the lack of IPTG should result in a low fluorescence signal,
    even in the presence of TPA, as transcription of the reporter protein is
    blocked. To test this, the signal of the promoter with the second
    modification was compared between an IPTG and no IPTG environment in
    increasing concentrations of TPA.

      the presence or not in the presence of IPTG with increasing concentrations
      of TPA
    </em>
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="paragraph fade-in">
    For every concentration of TPA, there is a slightly higher fluorescence
    signal in the presence of IPTG than not in the presence of IPTG, indicating
    the ability of the biosensor to detect TPA to at least some extent. This
    method ensures that the signal detected comes from the presence of TPA
    rather than some other substance. Slight increases in the signal in the
    no-IPTG environment can be explained by errors in the functionality of the
    repressor protein or variability in expression.

  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="paragraph fade-in">
    The data from the first fluorescence assay, regarding the sensitivity of
    MucK with the mEmerald reporter, and second assay, regarding the increased
    sensitivity of the second modification with sigma factors, were compared
    with and without TPA to determine the optimal results for maximum
    sensitivity of the sensor. There is a noticeable presence of background
    signal as the signal is around 500 even without IPTG. The increase in signal
    in groups without IPTG (in blue and yellow) can be explained by errors in
    the functionality of the repressor protein or expression of the genes.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph fade-in">
    There is an increase in sensitivity with both the mEmerald reporter and the
    sigma factor promoter modifications previously described, although the
    promoter modification seems to output a greater signal overall and has a
    greater increase in higher concentrations of TPA. Through these results, we
    can see the success and applicability of the parts developed in this
    research to detect the presence of TPA and use it as a quantifying indicator
    of PET degradation.
