    Team DNHS_SanDiego_CA is in full compliance with iGEM's safety and security
    guidelines. During the project's design, construction, and implementation
    phases, our utmost priority has consistently been safety. This commitment
    extends to incorporating special procedures, practices, and materials as
    necessary.

    All experiments were conducted at Scripps Research Institute in Badran Lab.
    Our working environment is a standard microbiological lab and is classified
    as biosafety level 1. There are chairs at each bench, multiple biohazard
    trash cans, and sinks in every row. At the back of the open bench region are
    -80 degrees Celsius freezers. Beside the open bench lab space is the
    incubator room. This room contains a variety of incubators and freezers,
    along with a fume hood. The neighboring spaces are temperature-regulated
    rooms that are used to run experiments in hot (37 Celcius) or cold (4
    Celcius) environments. Finally, the dark room is used for reading gel
    electrophoresis results.
  </p>
  <p class="fade-in">
    All experiments were thoroughly researched and performed with the guidance
    of scientists at the lab. For the conduction of the experiments, we used
    open bench areas, sterilized equipment, and biohazard bins to prevent
    contamination.
  </p>
  <p class="fade-in">
    Our project exclusively involves activities that adhere to all regulations
    (Scripps-specific biosafety regulations [1] and California biosafety
    regulations [2]), and all organisms and components utilized are listed as
    compliant on the iGEM competition's White List.

    We performed titration of our strains with Isopropyl
    ÃŸ-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and terephthalic acid (TPA) via an assay
    process. The media being used is Davis Rich Media with carbenicillin and
    spectinomycin.
  </p>
  <p class="fade-in">
    Our team designed parts pIGEM1 and pIGEM2, which we will upload to the
    repository. Throughout the experimentation, we will be using DMSO and
    ethidium bromide in controlled environments. When transferring the TPA into
    the tubes for serial dilutions, the TPA was kept in a DMSO solution, so
    contact with the solution through the transfer process is the only way for
    accidental contact with the compound. Transfer of Ethidium Bromide from one
    container to another was performed in a controlled environment with
    micropipettes to limit safety hazards.

    We used an MG1655-derived strain of Escherichia coli in building plasmids
    using various importers like MucK and TpaK, transcription factors, and
    promoters. MG1655 is non-pathogenic and poses minimal threat to human
    safety.

  <p class="fade-in">
    We wanted to address how consumers may feel about having and using a device
    that contains genetically engineered organisms. Some people may not want to
    be in close contact with E. coli because they may worry that it would be
    dangerous to their health. We plan to address this concern by educating
    those who wish to use this product by explaining that the MG1655-derived
    strain of E. coli used in this device is not harmful in any way to the human
    body and will not result in any illnesses. This explanation may be placed on
    the label of our product device in order for consumers to be aware of their
    safety. In addition, the early use of our device is marketed towards
    scientists who are aware of safe lab practices, so they should be aware of
    the components of our device and possible concerns.
