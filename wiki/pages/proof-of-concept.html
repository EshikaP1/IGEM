    To design and create a plasmid that, in the presence of TPA, will create a
    detectable fluorescent signal. Since TPA is a monomer product of the
    degradation of PET, optimizing the dynamic range of this signal will allow
    us to accurately measure PET degradation.

    Our team tested a variety of parts to design, build, and test four different
    plasmids. We designed our constructs based on previous data from the Badran
    lab that showed only a modest increase in fluorescent signal when TPA was
    titrated into cell culture. Each plasmid and assay are described below.

  <p class="paragraph fade-in">
    Initially, our plan was to experiment with MucK, found in reference 1, as a
    new importer to test if the importer previously used, tpaK, was limiting or
    non-functional. We also decided to test the effects different fluorescent
    reporters might have, and compared mScarlet to mEmerald to see which would
    produce a better signal. To do this, our team conducted an assay, testing
    combinations of mucK importer plasmid with reporter plasmids encoding either
    mScarlet or mEmerald.

    Above is plasmid pIGEM1. This is the plasmid map of the first plasmid our
    team made. It has the antibiotic resistance marker bla (AmpR) for
    carbenicillin to allow selection for the plasmids that have been correctly
    constructed, the mEmerald fluorescent protein, TpaR-Regulated Promoter
    (found in reference 2) as the promoter driving expression of TpaR and
    mEmerald, the origin of replication RepA and pSC101 to allow for plasmid
    propogation, transcription factor of RHA1 or tpaR (found in reference 2),
    and rrnB1 terminator. The part our team was interested in for this plasmid
    was mEmerald.

    Above is plasmid pAB132e18 and is very similar to pIGEM1. It has the same
    antibiotic resistance marker bla (AmpR) for carbenicillin, promoter of
    TpaR-Regulated Promoter, origin of replication RepA and pSC101,
    transcription factor RHA1 or tpaR, and terminator of rrnB1. The key
    difference is instead of mEmerald, the plasmid has mScarlet, which is the
    part our team is interested in.

    Above is plasmid pIGEM2. This plasmid has MucK as its importer of TPA, ColE1
    and Rop as its origin of replication, protein lacI and promoter pLacZ to
    control MucK, and antibiotic resistance marker aadA to confer spectinomycin
    resistance. The part of interest here is importer MucK. Below are graphs of
    the results from the first assay. These graphs and their respective data
    tables can also be found in the lab journal.

    From these graphs, our team noted that the largest fold increase was roughly
    2.25 for mScarlet with MucK and roughly 1.77 for mEmerald with MucK. While
    these increases are noticeable, it is not large enough for a robust
    biosensor. Furthermore, the background signal and how it increases in signal
    despite the absence of IPTG, a small molecule that binds to pLacZ to allow
    expression of MucK and thus TPA detection, does create some concern.
    Therefore, our team looked at other potential parts that could be inhibiting
    TPA detection. At this time, our team noticed that a promoter called pTPA3,
    also found in reference 1, worked decently well. Our team compared pTPA3 to
    TpaR-Regulated Promoter and found three modifications that could heighten
    our fold-increase: remove a native RBS site found in the TpaR-Regulated
    Promoter, alter the -35 and -10 sigma factor sections of the TpaR-Regulated
    Promoter sequence to match that of pTPA3, and entirely replace
    TpaR-Regulated Promoter with pTPA3. Our team then decided to conduct a
    second assay to compare these three modifications. Since the importer and
    reporter had to be kept constant in this assay and mEmerald with MucK and
    mScarlet with MucK performed similarly, our team just chose to use mEmerald
    with MucK. Since mEmerald came from pIGEM1, the first modification (removing
    the native RBS site) was called iGEM1a, the second modification (altering
    -35 and -10 sigma factors) was called iGEM1b, and the third modification
    (replace with pTPA3) was called iGEM1c. All the sequences and sequence
    changes can be seen below. In the parts page, iGEM1a was renamed
    TpaR-Regulated Promoter1.1, iGEM1b was renamed TpaR-Regulated Promoter1.2,
    and iGEM1c is pTPA3.
